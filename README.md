Augmented Reality project to follow the Mars Express Mission, develop for the Space Challenge 2014.
My idea here is trying to create today a google glass and android app that will first give the position and give the information about space mission. I am computer science engineer and also an Msc. in Artificial Intelligence. I worked a lot with virtual world, augmented reality, and Multi Agents Systems. I am senior software developer and data analytics expert.  I will love to be involved with amazing guys and teams, a follow their ideas, and also develops mines.  I will upload some code to my github account as soon I start develop this saturday.

More or least this is the concept of what you will see. But, you must be able to see the information with your phonecam, So i will also develop the application to run like a normal android Apps, that will instead displays the positions of missions currently in space, in front of you. I will take information from Mars Express.
